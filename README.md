# DPre-SDS2G
This repository contains our codes for the numerical experiments we conducted for the following PBN construction algorithms:
1. The Single Division Pre-processed SER2-GER algorithm (SDS2G)
2. The Greedy Entry Removal algorithm (GER)
3. The Simple Entry Removal algorithm 1 (SER 1)
4. The Simple Entry Removal algorithm 2 (SER 2)
5. MOMP-Interior Point Convex (MOMP-IPC)
6. MOMP-Active Set (MOMP-AS)
